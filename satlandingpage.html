<h2>SAT FAQ</h2>
<br/>
<h3>1. What is the SAT, and why is it important?</h3>
<br/>
<p>The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States. It assesses a student's readiness for college by testing skills in reading, writing, and math. Many colleges and universities use SAT scores as part of their admissions process, along with GPA, extracurricular activities, and essays.</p>
<br/>
<h3>2. What are the sections of the SAT, and how is it scored?</h3>
<br/>
<p>The SAT consists of two main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math. The EBRW section includes a Reading Test and a Writing and Language Test, while the Math section has both calculator and no-calculator portions. Each section is scored on a scale of 200-800, making the highest possible total score 1600.</p>
<br/>
<h3>3. How long is the SAT, and how many questions does it have?</h3>
<br/>
<p>The SAT is approximately 2 hours and 14 minutes long. It includes 98 total questions:

<li>Reading: 54 minutes, 27 questions</li>
<li>Writing and Language: 30 minutes, 26 questions</li>
<li>Math: 70 minutes, 45 questions (both calculator and no-calculator sections)</li></p>
<br/>
<h3>4. How often is the SAT offered, and when should I take it?</h3>
<br/>
<p>The SAT is typically offered seven times a year in the U.S. (March, May, June, August, October, November, and December). Most students take it in the spring of their junior year and may retake it in the fall of their senior year to improve their scores before college applications are due.</p>
<br/>
<h3>5. Can I use a calculator on the SAT?</h3>
<br/>
<p>Yes! The SAT now allows a graphing calculator for the entire Math section. The test is also digital, and it includes a built-in Desmos calculator, so students can choose whether to use their own calculator or the one provided in the test software.</p>

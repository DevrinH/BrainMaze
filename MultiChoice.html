                The recovery of southern sea otters appears to have taken an 
                upturn, according to results from the annual California sea 
                otter survey released by the U.S. Geological Survey. Yet 
                despite an overall increase in sea otter abundance, sharks 
                have been “taking a bite” out of the portion of the population 
                that could fuel expansion into new areas.

                “There’s much more to the story here than the main finding would 
                suggest,” said Dr. Tim Tinker, a research ecologist who leads the
                 USGS sea otter research program. “We are looking into various 
                 factors that may be affecting the survey results, including a boom
                  in urchin abundance from Big Sur to Monterey that may explain the
                   uptick in numbers in the range center, and high levels of shark 
                   bite mortality that are likely responsible for continued declines 
                   at the north and south ends of the range.”

                    This year’s survey results suggest an increasing trend over the last 
                    five years of almost 2 percent per year and the population index, a 
                    statistical representation of the entire population calculated as the 
                    three-year running average of census counts, has climbed to 3,054 from 
                    2,711 in 2010. The growth is accounted for by an unexpected jump in numbers 
                    in the center of the sea otter’s range, an area that spans from Monterey south 
                    to Cambria.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While the population index continues to trend upward, the northern and southern 
                    subsets of the population continue a five-year decline, dropping 2 percent and 3.4 
                    percent per year, respectively, numbers consistent with increased shark bite induced 
                    mortality in these same areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since the 1980s, USGS scientists have computed the annual population index and evaluated 
                    trends in the southern sea otter, “Enhydra lutris nereis,” a federally listed threatened 
                    species found in California. For southern sea otters to be considered for removal from 
                    threatened species listing under the Endangered Species Act, the population index would 
                    have to exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years.

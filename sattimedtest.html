        <p>The recovery of southern sea otters appears to have taken an upturn, according to results from 
            the annual California sea otter survey released by the U.S. Geological Survey. Yet despite an overall 
            increase in sea otter abundance, sharks have been “taking a bite” out of the portion of the population that could 
            fuel expansion into new areas.<p>

            <p>“There’s much more to the story here than the main finding would suggest,” said Dr. Tim Tinker, a research 
                ecologist who leads the USGS sea otter research program. “We are looking into various factors that may be 
                affecting the survey results, including a boom in urchin abundance from Big Sur to Monterey that may explain 
                the uptick in numbers in the range center, and high levels of shark bite mortality that are likely responsible 
                for continued declines at the north and south ends of the range.”</p>
        
              <p> This year’s survey results suggest an increasing trend over the last five years of almost 2 percent per year 
                and the population index, a statistical representation of the entire population calculated as the three-year running 
                average of census counts, has climbed to 3,054 from 2,711 in 2010. The growth is accounted for by an unexpected jump in 
                numbers in the center of the sea otter’s range, an area that spans from Monterey south to Cambria.</p>

                <p>While the population index continues to trend upward, the northern and southern subsets of the population continue a 
                  five-year decline, dropping 2 percent and 3.4 percent per year, respectively, numbers consistent with increased shark 
                  bite induced mortality in these same areas.</p>

                  <p>Since the 1980s, USGS scientists have computed the annual population index and evaluated trends in the southern sea
                     otter, “Enhydra lutris nereis,” a federally listed threatened species found in California. For southern sea otters to 
                     be considered for removal from threatened species listing under the Endangered Species Act, the population index would 
                     have to exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years.

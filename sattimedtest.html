        <p>The recovery of southern sea otters appears to have taken an upturn, according to results from 
            the annual California sea otter survey released by the U.S. Geological Survey. Yet despite an overall 
            increase in sea otter abundance, sharks have been “taking a bite” out of the portion of the population that could 
            fuel expansion into new areas.<p>

            <p>“There’s much more to the story here than the main finding would suggest,” said Dr. Tim Tinker, a research 
                ecologist who leads the USGS sea otter research program. “We are looking into various factors that may be 
                affecting the survey results, including a boom in urchin abundance from Big Sur to Monterey that may explain 
                the uptick in numbers in the range center, and high levels of shark bite mortality that are likely responsible 
                for continued declines at the north and south ends of the range.”</p>
